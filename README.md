## AmazingNumbers
### About:
We use numbers every day. They have many different properties. In this project we will look 
at some of the amazing properties of numbers. I've written a program that knows how to determine 
whether a number is Palindromic or Gapful, or how to distinguish Spy numbers from others. 
Numbers can be fascinating!
### Description:
I've used in the project basic operations on integers, as well as with collections, enums, 
and static util classes. Also I've realized checking by test cases witn JUnit 4 library.
I've made a program that indicates the properties of the numbers taken from the input.
